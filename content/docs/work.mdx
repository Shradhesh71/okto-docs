# How the Okto Layer Works

The Okto Layer simplifies blockchain interactions by abstracting the complexity of multi-chain transactions, liquidity, and wallet management. It ensures a seamless user experience, handling complex processes behind the scenes with precision and efficiency.

## Interaction Flow

**1. User Request via Gateway**

- A user initiates a request through a user-friendly DApp interface connected to the Okto Gateway.
- For example, the user might request, “Transfer USDC from Ethereum to BNB Chain and stake it.”
- The Gateway validates the request and calculates the associated costs.

**2. Job Creation on the Okto Chain**

- The validated request is sent to the **Okto Chain**, where it is converted into a "job."
- This job specifies the user's intent, such as bridging assets and staking tokens.
- The job is recorded immutably on the Okto Chain for transparency and coordination.

**3. Orchestration by the Decentralized Transaction Networks (DTN)**

- The DTN picks up the job, breaks it into subtasks, and executes them in sequence.
- For example:
  1. Move USDC from Ethereum to BNB Chain using the **Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL)**.
  2. Stake tokens on the BNB Chain.
- If issues arise, such as failed transactions, the DTN retries the operation automatically.

## On-Chain and Off-Chain Interactions

The Okto Layer effectively combines on-chain and off-chain processes to optimize speed, security, and user experience.

### On-Chain Processes:

1. **Immutable Ledger for Coordination**

   - The **Okto Chain** records jobs, user intents, wallet permissions, and policy data.
   - This provides a tamper-proof record of every action and its associated details.

2. **Policy and Permission Management**

   - The chain manages wallet permissions, approved bridging solutions, and solvers.

3. **Scalability and Efficiency**

   - Leveraging rollup technology, the Okto Chain ensures scalability while maintaining cost-efficiency.

4. **Proof Storage**
   - The chain securely stores zero-knowledge proofs and hashed data, ensuring accuracy and preventing tampering.

### Off-Chain Processes:

1. **ULL for Liquidity Optimization**

   - Aggregates data from solutions like Socket or LayerZero to determine the most efficient route for asset transfers.
   - Considers speed, cost, and security in real-time.

2. **Transaction Preparation by DTN**

   - Prepares transactions by adding gas fees, nonce values, and other essential details.
   - Arranges transactions in an optimal order, running independent operations in parallel.

3. **Secure Signing by DWN**
   - The **Decentralized Wallet Network (DWN)** ensures that all transactions are signed securely using MPC-secured nodes.
   - Verifies alignment with the Okto Chain’s records before signing.

## Key Processes

1. **Transaction Lifecycle Management by DTN**

   - Manages the end-to-end transaction process, handling issues like chain reorganizations and gas price fluctuations.
   - Executes subtasks such as swapping, bridging, and staking assets across chains.

2. **Unified Liquidity Layer Operations**

   - The ULL enables efficient cross-chain swaps by utilizing solvers who front liquidity and settle later.

3. **Secure Execution**

   - Every transaction is closely monitored until confirmed on the blockchain, ensuring reliability.

4. **Final Logging on Okto Chain**
   - Logs the outcome—success or failure—providing users with a transparent and immutable record.

## Example Walkthrough

### Simplifying a Complex Task:

**Objective:** Transfer USDC from Ethereum to BNB Chain and stake it.

- **Step 1:** The user makes a request through a DApp interface.
- **Step 2:** The Gateway validates the request and sends it to the Okto Chain.
- **Step 3:** The DTN breaks the job into subtasks, prepares transactions, and consults the ULL for optimal routes.
- **Step 4:** The DWN securely signs all transactions.
- **Step 5:** The DTN executes the transactions, monitors confirmations, and retries failed actions if necessary.
- **Step 6:** The Okto Chain logs the final result, ensuring transparency.
- **Step 7:** The user sees the result: USDC successfully staked on the BNB Chain.

## What Makes the Okto Layer Unique?

1. **Unified Coordination:**

   - Combines the power of DWNs, ULL, and DTN into a cohesive ecosystem.

2. **Scalability and Security:**

   - Rollup-based architecture ensures cost-effective and secure operations.

3. **Developer-Friendly:**

   - Provides APIs and SDKs for easy integration into existing applications.

4. **Trustless and Transparent:**
   - Leverages blockchain’s innate transparency to log and verify every operation.
